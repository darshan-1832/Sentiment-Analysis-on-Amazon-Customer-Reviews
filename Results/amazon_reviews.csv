Sanat Mishra,11 November 2024,5.0,"The mobile phone is awesome and it has all the features which anyone would like to have in a 5G smartphone. The Sound Quality is also good, loud sound good speakers. And overall working is also fine and smooth. In terms of connectivity, the phone is 5G enabled and I tested with 5G sim card and speed crossed 200 MBPS in Jio. Working speed is incredible as all the apps launches quickly without any lag. Got it delivered the next day, due to Prime Membership.Thanks OnePlus and Amazon."
Adv. Y. P. Kaushal,10 October 2024,4.0,My review :Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price.Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k.Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%.Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment.Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option.Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special  if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.
Raju kumtekar,2 September 2024,5.0,"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint."
Worst product don't buy this type of product,27 October 2024,4.0,"The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite 5G packs impressive 5G speed, a smooth display, and solid performance at an affordable price, making it a smart choice for those who want reliable features without breaking the bank."
Pawan Kumar Jha,18 October 2024,3.0,"The media could not be loaded.Never buy a phone with Snapdragon 695 if you like to consume 4K video content.The processor of the Nord CE4 Lite 5G phone doesn't support 4 K video playback or recording and doesn't even support 4 K HDR on YouTube.I tried to play MAD MAX FURY ROAD (4K) using a VLC media player, and the video started lagging several times. The same video I played smoothly on my other phone, XIAOMI 11 LITE NE 5G. No issue at all.If you can ignore these cons, the phone is GREAT in terms of battery backup, visual appearance due to its AMOLED screen, refresh rate that you can change at will, and butter-like smoothness in navigating and using apps. Regarding bloatware, yes, they were aplenty but they are easily removable.Camera quality is also good if not very satisfactory considering the price. Since I am not a gamer, so, I can't tell you about gaming performance but based on its inbuilt processor's capabilities, I guess it can pretty much handle less GPU-intensive games like Call of Duty.About charging performance, let me tell you that at the time of switching on the phone and installing a few updates, the battery was around 50%. So, I charged it with its given charger, and within 16 minutes, the battery was fully charged. Therefore, I feel that the slow charging claim of this phone is theoretical and misleading.Beware that there has been huge marketing about the Nord CE 4 Lite 5G phone, calling it an excellent performer. Excellence depends on the user experience, not speculation.I am convinced that if you ignore the phone's processor, the rest of its features are good if you buy it under Rs15000. That's the only justifiable price I set for this phone based on my experience."
Shakir Ahmad,17 November 2024,5.0,"If you're having budget under 20K, then you must have this. Pretty good experience have in display finger print working so smooth. Silver colour back is also so beautiful. Value for money in this range."
Aniket Patel,8 October 2024,4.0,"Pros :Data transfer form old phone is like cakewalk .Good build quality and finish .Excellent display .Good camera and performance in bright ambient light . Low light performance fantastic . But there are issues in moderately lit environment. Images attached for reference .Video quality is nice .Good battery life .Nice speaker sound quality .Microphone is sensitive .Charging is very fast .Good performance for games which are not resource hungry.Phone is quick for day to day usage .No heating issue .Cons :Display is very badtouch sensitive not as expected you need to touch 2 or 3 times for an action on the screen5500 battery is not as expected will have to keep wifi or data in off so to save battery till evening , My old 4000 mah in samsung was better battery performance than this 1+"
Adarsh,26 October 2024,3.0,"I picked up the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite as a spare business phone, focusing specifically on battery life and fast charging. For a price of 16K with 256GB storage and free earphones, it seemed like a great deal. However, my main needs weren't met.Despite the 5000mAh battery, the performance is average at best, and it doesn't stand out for all-day business use. The advertised 80W charging felt more like a gimmick, taking around 1 hour and 15 minutes for a full charge — a letdown if you’re expecting rapid power-ups.While the storage and price make it an appealing package, the lackluster battery and misleading charging claims mean it doesn’t fully satisfy my business needs, hence the 3-star rating."
Tamal,2 November 2024,4.0,"Have been using the phone for two weeks now. Previously was using Nokia 5.3 and the Oxygen OS is very close to vanilla Android experience I was getting on the Nokia 5.3. Will list out the pros and cons,Pros:1. Friendly user interface and close to vanilla Android experience2. Fantastic screen with vivid colours and responsive touch interface3. Light weight and well balanced4. Phone ships with a charger, case and screen guard applied. Something rare these days5. Battery easily lasts close to two days with moderate use such as social media, emails, calls etc. Fast charging is very impressive and charges from 20 to 100% in one hour6. Sound output is very goodCons:1. Can't find much as it has been only two weeks of use but photos captured aren't that great when you compare to Samsung phones innthe same price range2. The screen guard which came pre applied is bit of a dust magnet"
Taranath Amin,10 November 2024,4.0,"Mobile is very nice and features are up to mark....but while receiving call from watsup  on screen names can't see it blank I have to press button open lock.. ..then we can see names .,.and network problem also their it's shift 5g to 4g ..... Rest are good sound , smoothness, picture quality and charging is quick."
Placeholder,6 November 2024,4.0,The overall performance of the phone is really good. It's as you would except of a one plus product. The camera works as promised. It's decent at low light levels as well. My only issue is with the shrillness of the audio at high vol levels. Compared to other one plus phones it's a bit much.
Malschedsfj,12 November 2024,4.0,"I like the new phone so far, yet I do have difficulties with kloning the old phone and a few other ""new"" things which can be overwhelming.Shipping was good, thank you Amazon India!"

Rishisharma,4 November 2024,4.0,Working good little hanging issue found but now ok
Vinod Kumar Achyuthan Kutty,19 November 2024,3.0,The worst part is that the battery does not last for 12 hours even with average use. There is limitation for dual apps which is not so in Xiaomi or other phones. The drainage of battery is too much. The second worst part is Whatsapp will not show up in most cases for newly added numbers even if they have whatsapp and we have to ask them to send a whatsapp message to get them into our whatsapp list. I am terribly disappointed
