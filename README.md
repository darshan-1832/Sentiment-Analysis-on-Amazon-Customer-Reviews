# 📢 Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Customer-Reviews 

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze customer sentiment from **Amazon product reviews** using **NLP and deep learning**. The model is built on **BERT (bert-base-uncased)** and classifies reviews as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative**. The insights derived can help businesses understand customer engagement and product feedback.  

This project is a **quick and beginner-friendly implementation** of **Sentiment Analysis** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. The goal is to analyze Amazon reviews and classify their sentiment.  

The model is built using **BERT** for sequence classification, providing a strong baseline for sentiment analysis. While this version works well for beginners, it is designed with **future fine-tuning** in mind to improve accuracy and adaptability for different datasets.  

🚧 **Future Improvements**:  
- Fine-tuning the BERT model on a **larger, domain-specific dataset**  
- Optimizing the training pipeline with **hyperparameter tuning**  
- Deploying the model using **Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit**  


## 🚀 **Key Features**
✔ **Web Scraping** – Extracts Amazon reviews using **Selenium** & **BeautifulSoup**  
✔ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans and structures review data  
✔ **Fine-Tuned BERT Model** – Classifies reviews into sentiment categories  
✔ **A/B Testing** – Compares customer engagement metrics  
✔ **Statistical Analysis** – Evaluates the impact of review sentiments
